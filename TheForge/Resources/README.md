# Resources

**Purpose:** Static assets used by the project.

**Rules:**
- All resources must be referenced deterministically
- No embedded resources unless explicitly required
- Resources must be organized by type
- All resources must be documented

**Structure:**
- `/Images` — Icons, UI assets, branding
- `/Data` — JSON, XML, CSV, or sample datasets
- `/Localization` — Language files, resource dictionaries (optional)

**Cross-references:**
- See file2.md for resource organization rules
