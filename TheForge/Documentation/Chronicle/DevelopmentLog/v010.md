## v0.1.0 — Initial Project Restructuring (2025-01-02)

### Description
Complete restructuring of the project to align with RCH UI Forge standards. Established foundational folder structure, documentation taxonomy, and project configuration.

### What It Does
- Provides standardized folder structure following file2.md, file3.md, file4.md
- Establishes documentation taxonomy in `/Documentation`
- Configures VB.NET project with Option Strict On, Option Explicit On, Option Infer Off
- Creates basic DashboardMainForm with three-panel layout

### Issues Encountered

#### Issue 1: NoStartupFormException on Launch
**Problem:** Application failed to start with `NoStartupFormException` even after creating DashboardMainForm.

**Root Cause:** The `Application.myapp` file still referenced the old `Form1` instead of the new `DashboardMainForm`.

**Resolution:** Updated `My Project\Application.myapp`:
```xml
<MainForm>DashboardMainForm</MainForm>
```

#### Issue 2: Multiple Dots in Namespace Causing Form Lookup Failure
**Problem:** Application continued to throw `NoStartupFormException` even after updating Application.myapp.

**Root Cause:** VB.NET's WinForms application framework had trouble resolving forms with multi-dotted namespaces like `RCH.Forge.Dashboard.DashboardMainForm`.

**Resolution:** Changed `RootNamespace` from `RCH.Forge.Dashboard` to `TheForge` in the project file, while keeping `AssemblyName` as `RCH.Forge.Dashboard`:
```xml
<RootNamespace>TheForge</RootNamespace>
<AssemblyName>RCH.Forge.Dashboard</AssemblyName>
```

#### Issue 3: File Corruption During Command-Line Edits
**Problem:** Multiple attempts to edit `DashboardMainForm.vb` using PowerShell commands resulted in file corruption or markdown content replacing code.

**Root Cause:** PowerShell here-strings with VB.NET syntax caused parsing errors. The `edit_file` tool also had intermittent issues with the file.

**Resolution:** 
1. Used file deletion and recreation strategy
2. Created temporary files with `_temp` suffix, then moved them
3. Eventually used `edit_file` tool successfully after file stabilization

### Development Patterns & Lessons Learned

1. **File Editing via Terminal**
   - PowerShell here-strings with VB.NET syntax are problematic
   - Solution: Use `edit_file` tool when possible, or create temp files

2. **VB.NET Reserved Keywords**
   - Watch for keywords: Module, Property, Class, Interface, etc.
   - Solution: Use descriptive suffixes (moduleInterface, serviceInstance)

3. **Namespace Resolution**
   - Multi-dot namespaces cause issues in WinForms framework
   - Solution: Keep RootNamespace simple, use AssemblyName for branding

### Build Status
? **Build Status:** Success  
? **Runtime Status:** Runs  
? **Notes:** Initial restructuring complete
