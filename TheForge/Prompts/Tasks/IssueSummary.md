Create or update a file named IssueSummary.md inside the /Chronicle directory.

Follow the repository's Copilot instructions and the Forge rule stack.
Do not restate or reinterpret any existing rules.

Task:
Generate a high?level, generalized summary of all recurring development issues and their resolutions across the entire project. The summary must be abstract, non?technical, and not tied to any specific milestone or implementation details.

Requirements:
- Categorize issues by root?cause type (e.g., AI/IDE interaction failures, state inconsistencies, parsing/data handling issues, dependency/order problems, performance bottlenecks, error?handling gaps, platform/tooling limitations, layout/order issues, file management problems).
- For each category:
    - Provide a short description of the issue pattern.
    - Describe the generalized symptoms.
    - Describe the generalized resolution pattern.
    - Do not include code or milestone?specific details.
- Order categories by frequency (most common first).
- Keep the summary concise, readable, and suitable for end?of?project analysis.
- This file will be used to derive future rules, standards, and governance patterns.

Output:
- A complete IssueSummary.md file containing the categorized, frequency?ordered summary.
