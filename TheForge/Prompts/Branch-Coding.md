# 1. Purpose
The Coding Branch defines all rules governing code generation and modification within the RCH UI Forge ecosystem.  
It ensures determinism, clarity, modularity, and consistency across all implementation tasks.

This branch governs **code only**.  
It does not define documentation rules, architectural rules, or audit rules.

---

# 2. Scope
The Coding Branch applies to:

- VB.NET code generation  
- UI control creation  
- Designer file behavior  
- Services and modules  
- Event handlers  
- Naming in code  
- Error handling  
- Layout logic  
- Refactoring  
- Code cleanup  
- Implementation discipline  

This branch does **not** apply to:

- Documentation (Documentation Branch)  
- Project structure (Architecture Branch)  
- Auditing (ForgeAudit)  

---

# 3. Authoritative Sources
The Coding Branch draws from:

- ForgeCharter (universal governance)  
- Implementation discipline defined by the Forge ethos  
- Coding standards established across the Forge ecosystem  
- UI determinism principles  
- Modular service design principles  

No other source may override this branch.

# 4. Coding Rules

## 4.1 Language & Compiler Rules
All generated or modified code must:

- Use **VB.NET**  
- Use the following compiler settings:  
  - `Option Strict On`  
  - `Option Explicit On`  
  - `Option Infer Off`  
- Avoid implicit conversions  
- Avoid hidden state  
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers  
- Avoid commented‑out code  
- Avoid unused code  
- Avoid TODOs without owners  

---

## 4.2 Class & Module Rules
All classes must:

- Have explicit, descriptive names  
- Include a summary of purpose  
- Be deterministic and predictable  
- Avoid vague names (Helper, Manager, Utils, etc.)  
- Follow Forge‑themed naming where appropriate  
- Expose explicit, documented interfaces  
- Avoid leaking internal state  

Modules must:

- Have a single, clear purpose  
- Be reusable across projects  
- Avoid UI dependencies  
- Avoid circular dependencies  

---

## 4.3 Service Rules
Services must:

- Be stateless when possible  
- Be testable  
- Avoid side effects  
- Avoid ad‑hoc instantiation  
- Use dependency injection  
- Use explicit interfaces  

---

# 5. UI & Designer Rules

## 5.1 Designer File Boundaries
Designer files must:

- Contain **only** control declarations  
- Contain **only** layout initialization  
- Contain **InitializeComponent()**  
- Never contain business logic  
- Never contain event handlers  
- Never contain custom methods  

Main `.vb` files must:

- Never declare controls  
- Never duplicate Designer declarations  
- Never modify Designer‑generated code  

---

## 5.2 Control Naming Rules
All controls must:

- Have explicit, descriptive names  
- Avoid default names (Button1, TextBox1, etc.)  
- Follow deterministic naming patterns  
- Reflect purpose, not appearance  

---

## 5.3 Layout Rules
All UI layout must:

- Use deterministic layout behavior  
- Avoid flicker, resizing jumps, or implicit behavior  
- Use explicit Anchor or Dock rules  
- Avoid overlapping controls  
- Avoid hidden or implicit behaviors  

---

## 5.4 Event Handler Rules
Event handlers must:

- Contain no business logic  
- Delegate to services or modules  
- Avoid side effects  
- Avoid inline logic blocks  
- Avoid long methods  
- Avoid UI‑driven state management  
---
## 5.5 Default Layout Policy
The Forge uses a deterministic layout model. Unless the user explicitly requests otherwise, the following rules apply:

1. **Anchor is the default layout mode for all controls.**  
   - The AI must always assign explicit Anchor values.  
   - Controls must never rely on Designer defaults or implicit behavior.

2. **Dock is only used when explicitly requested by the user.**  
   - Phrases such as “dock”, “fill”, “full height”, “full width”, or “left panel that fills” qualify as explicit requests.  
   - The AI must not infer Dock behavior from context alone.

3. **Anchor and Dock must never be mixed on the same control.**  
   - If Dock is used, Anchor must be omitted.  
   - If Anchor is used, Dock must be omitted.

4. **Implicit layout behavior is forbidden.**  
   - No AutoSize‑driven layout unless explicitly requested.  
   - No reliance on default margins, padding, or control placement.  
   - All layout behavior must be explicit and deterministic.

5. **Resizing must remain stable and predictable.**  
   - Controls must not drift, overlap, or resize unpredictably.  
   - Minimum form size must be set when necessary to preserve layout integrity.

This policy ensures that all UI generated by the Forge behaves consistently across machines, resolutions, and DPI settings.
# 6. Error Handling Rules
Error handling must:

- Be explicit  
- Avoid silent suppression  
- Avoid swallowing exceptions  
- Avoid empty `Catch` blocks  
- Use structured exception handling  
- Avoid global exception traps unless justified  

---

# 7. Non‑Interference Boundaries
The Coding Branch:

- Does **not** define documentation rules  
- Does **not** define project structure  
- Does **not** define taxonomy  
- Does **not** define audit behavior  
- Does **not** override ForgeCharter  

It governs **code only**.

---

# 8. Routing Behavior
The Coding Branch is invoked when:

- The user requests code  
- The user requests UI controls  
- The user requests Designer behavior  
- The user requests refactoring  
- The user requests implementation details  
- The user requests layout logic  
- The user requests error handling  

Routing:
