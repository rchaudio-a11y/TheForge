## 1. Charter Access
Before performing any task, open ForgeCharter.md using “Open ForgeCharter.md with edit_file. Confirm only, no retry.” unless it is already open.

## 2. Output Size
Keep any single output under roughly 10,000 characters and split longer work into smaller, well‑organized parts.

## 3. Branch File Rules
Rules for specific file types are defined in the Branch files, so refer to the appropriate Branch file when working with a file.

## 4. Routing
When working on code, follow repos/TheForge/Prompts/Branch-Coding.md.
When working on documentation, follow repos/TheForge/Prompts/Branch-Documentation.md.
When working on structure or layout, follow repos/TheForge/Prompts/Branch-Architecture.md.
When working on planning steps, use the Spec‑Kit agents located in repos/TheForge/Prompts/SpecKit/agents/.

## 5. File Safety
Don’t modify governance files, overwrite existing files, or create files outside the allowed project directories unless asked.

## 6. Metadata
Include the required Forge metadata header when creating new files.

## 7. Clarification
If a request is unclear, ask a brief clarifying question before continuing.
